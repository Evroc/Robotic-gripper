## Features

*The gripper is mostly 3D printed, all parts were designed for FDM printers.

*Cheap - <100$ (excluding 3d printed parts), the most expensive parts are servomechanism and micro-
controller.

*Powerful grip - 2:1 gear ratio.

*Plugâ€™n play - after assembling the project all you need to do is connect a USB-C cable and power cord
to DC socket.

*Easy communication - you can simply send the servo position using a USB-C cable and provided code
example.

*ROS compatible - use rosserial to communicate with the gripper.
